### CPSC 120 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was one of my favorite lab because it was interesting view the files. Part 1 and 2, while simple,
    were fun to interact with opening and making files. In part 3, It was interesting to see animations
    being played, such as the firework and Godzilla vs Bambi animations. 

* Lab 12
    
    Lab 12 was my second favorite lab since I was able to have a lot of fun tinkering with the values. The 
    gif in part 1 was intertesting to oberseve after realizing we were using radian values to make animations.
    Part 2 was fun since we were able to input our own messages.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11 was my favorite lab out all the ones we've done this semester. While part 1 was fun learning about
    how constructors work, it was part 2 that made me enjoy it. Part 2 showed me how far I've come in this class,
    as this finally allowed us to make a hi-lo game code with both random numbers and the ability for two 
    players to play. 

**Two custom files I made:**
